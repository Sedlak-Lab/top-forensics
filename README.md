Source Code from "The Total Oxidizable Precursor (TOP) Assay as a Forensic Tool for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Source Apportionment"

To use the web application, navigate to top-forensics.herokuapp.com. A template can be downloaded from the website that matches the necesary csv format. Input data into the template. Note that the change in PFCAs due to the TOP assay must be calculated prior to input into the template. All units should be in pM, nM, etc. 

No more than 20-30 samples should be uploaded at a time. Uploading more than this will result in the website timing out or will make it difficult to read your sample names. If you need to run more than this, consider uploading in batches.
